My Google Data Analytics Certificate capstone project about meat, dairy and eggs consumption related with Alzheimerâ€™s disease and dementia

## Motivation
I completed this course on Data Analytics instructed by Google itself and I wanted to put some of the skills into practice. Not just that, but I also wanted to work with relevant data. Health and diet are two topics I'm really interested in trying to improve and optimize, I thought looking at data related with them would be a great start.

From all the health-related fields I could have chosen, I decided to go with Alzheimer's disease and dementia. It scares me, to be honest, and more than most of the other diseases. I wanted to make this as personal as possible to enjoy it to the fullest.

## Disclaimer
This is not perfect by any means and it doesn't even showcase everything I'm capable of. This is just me tinkering with some code trying to see what I can find!
